Hey everyone!
I am <b>Shreyas </b>, an Integrated Dual Degree student at Indian Institute of Technology Madras with a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering and an M.Tech in Robotics. I also have a minor in Computing. 

My interests lie in Deep Learning and Computer Vision and I'm currently working under Prof. AN Rajagopalan @ Image Processing and Computer Vision (IPCV) Lab, IIT Madras. I am a highly passionate coder and have also dabbled in competitive programming. I love solving puzzles and racking my brain on tough problems. 

I enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee and Football in my spare time. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
